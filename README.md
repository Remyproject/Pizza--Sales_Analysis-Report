I analyzed the sales data of a pizza restaurant for the year 2015. The data was collected from the restaurant's POS system and included information about the date, time, pizza type, size, quantity, and price of each order.

Data Quality
The data was cleaned and prepared for analysis by removing blanks, changing the data type of the date, time, and price columns, and checking for duplicates. The final dataset consisted of 48,620 rows and 11 columns.

Data Profiling
The data profiling results showed that the average price of a pizza was \$16.82, and the total revenue for the year was \$817,860.05. The most popular pizza type was the Thai Chicken Pizza, with 2,313 orders. The week's busiest day was Friday, and the busiest time was in the evening.

Problem Solving
I used the analysis to identify trends in pizza sales, such as which pizzas are most popular and when pizza sales are highest. This information can be used to make better marketing decisions and improve the customer experience. For example, the restaurant could promote Thai Chicken Pizza more heavily during the summer, which is typically the most popular.
The analysis was also used to solve specific problems, such as identifying why pizza sales were declining, or a particular pizza was not selling well. This information can be used to make changes to the business that will improve sales. For example, if the restaurant found that pizza sales declined on weekdays, they could offer discounts or coupons to encourage more weekday orders.

Results

The following are some of the key findings from the analysis:
The best month for pizza sales was January, followed by July.
The best days of the week for pizza sales were Friday and Saturday.
The busiest time of day for pizza sales was in the evening.
The most popular pizza type was the Thai Chicken Pizza.
The total number of pizza orders was approximately 21,000.
The total sales of pizza was approximately \$50,000.
The total revenue from pizza sales was \$817,860.05.
The average order value was approximately \$38.


Conclusion
The analysis of the pizza sales data for 2015 has revealed some interesting trends and insights. The restaurant can use this information to make better marketing decisions and improve the customer experience. By understanding what pizzas are most popular and when pizza sales are highest, the restaurant can allocate its resources more effectively and boost its profits.
The analysis has also identified some specific problems that the restaurant can address. For example, the restaurant can increase pizza sales on weekdays for pizzas not currently selling well. The restaurant can improve its bottom line and continue to be a successful business by making these changes.
